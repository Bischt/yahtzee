# Yahtzee!

Simple terminal based Yahtzee! game.

There are a few game modes:

1. **Traditional:** Players take turns and makes the optimal choice for the roll
2. **Waterfall:** Each player goes down the list one by one and attempts to score the best in each line
3. **Head-2-Head:** Each player goes down the list one by one but unlike Waterfall each line will be a competition where the player with more points scores the victory (unless tie)
4. **One Roll:** Each turn you will only get one roll before scoring win/lose decision based on which player scores the highest.  Number of wins matters, not score.
